# Implementing Naïve Bayes Classifier, LSTM and BERT on

# SPAM/HAM and 20 News Group

### Akshay Bhosale


## Naïve Bayes Classifier

- SPAM/HAM
    - Easy and quick
    - Bag of words model
    - 97.8% Accuracy

 - 20 News Group
    - Easy and quick for a larger dataset as
             well
    - Bag of words model for focused
             observations
    - 72.8% Accuracy


## LSTM

- SPAM/HAM
    - Not so dense architecture
    - 87.15% accuracy
 
- 20 News Group
    - Simple architecture considering the
       size of the dataset
    - Validation accuracy not more than
       33.5%
    - While high training accuracy, we are
       left with very low validation accuracy


## BERT

- SPAM/HAM
    - Using pretrained BERT model with
       Transformers
    - Validation Accuracy at 98.21%
       
- 20 News Group
    - Using pretrained BERT model with
             Transformers
    - Validation Accuracy at 68.2%
